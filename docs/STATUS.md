## Done

### Authored Tier-B corpus — 3 grounded cases (2026-07-20) ✅
Hand-authored **3 full-Tier-B crash test cases**, each grounded in real fleet source, committed at
`groundloop/mine/data/authored/` (branch `feat/authored-tierb-cases`): `crash-01-native-audio-resampler`
(**oboe**, C++ native audio, native `.so` backtrace naming `MultiChannelResampler::writeFrame`),
`crash-02-java-stream-helper` (**newpipe**, Java/Android, Java stacktrace naming
`SecondaryStreamHelper.getStream`), `crash-03-c-logging-message` (**dlt-daemon**, C, automotive
Diagnostic Log & Trace, native SIGSEGV backtrace naming `dlt_message_read`). This is GroundLoop's
**first owned, reproducible, end-to-end substrate** — a standard case dir per case (`ticket.json` +
`_oracle/oracle.json` + `logs/crash.txt` + `fix.diff`) with a full end-to-end oracle (`owning_repo`,
`expected_files`, `required_apis`, `fix_patch`, `owning_repo_sha`, `is_answerable=true`,
`bug_kind="crash"`).
- **Why authored, not mined:** mining real crash-with-fix cases on the current fleet yields ~1 usable
  case (only 1 of 108 mine74 cases carries a crash log) — mining alone can't populate Tier B.
- **The anti-fabrication gate:** a new hermetic-tested validator,
  `groundloop/mine/authored.py::validate_authored_case`, returns `[]` for all 3 cases only because every
  `expected_files`/`required_apis` entry is verified against the real repo text, the crash log names a
  real oracle symbol, the ticket (incl. the case `id`) never leaks the `owning_repo` name (leak-safe),
  and `fix.diff` applies **clean** (`git apply --check`, zero fuzz/offset) against the pinned
  `owning_repo_sha` while touching `expected_files` and referencing `required_apis` on an added line.
- **The `[authored]` framing (load-bearing, honest):** these cases are **designed, not observed** — a
  **mechanics/capability test** ("does the loop carry a realistic crash end-to-end — match → localize →
  fix — over real code?"), **not an effectiveness measurement**. Tagged `[authored]`, distinct from
  `[proxy]`/`[production]`: **never `[production]`** (no real JIRA/Gerrit behind them) and **never
  blended** with the mined `[proxy]` corpus. **No live read has run yet.**
- **`core/` + atlas schema zero-diff.** Docs: `docs/evaluation.md`, `groundloop/mine/data/authored/README.md`.
  Spec/plan: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-authored-tierb-cases-design.md`,
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-20-authored-tierb-cases.md`.
- **OPEN — the gated funnel follow-up (not done):** run `render_e2e_funnel` over the 3 cases — match +
  localize graded against the real fleet atlas (`/mnt/x/code/corpora/atlas-fleet.db`), fix graded against
  the gateway. Needs a built atlas + gateway creds, so it's gated Type-2, not hermetic — the next step.

### Realistic end-to-end eval corpus — hermetic machinery shipped, no live read yet (2026-07-19) ✅
Shipped the **hermetic machinery** for a realistic, full-end-to-end `[proxy]` eval corpus (branch
`feat/e2e-eval-corpus`, ~6 commits). **This is machinery, ready to run — no live read has run yet.**
- **The problem it targets:** every effectiveness read to date ran on the **mine74 prose regime** (OSS
  feature/UI issues, ~0 logs) — a shape production never sends; the one `[proxy]`-vs-`[production]`
  localize check (the `dispatch` arm) came back **0/10 INERT** for exactly that reason. First principle:
  **grounding over narrative — small-real over large-fake.**
- **New machinery (all labs, hermetic-tested):** a crash-log + merged-fix admission gate
  (`has_crash_signature` + `admit_e2e` in `groundloop/mine/{signal,gh_miner}.py`, surfaced as `gloop mine
  --require-crash-log --require-merged-fix`); a committed case manifest (`groundloop/mine/manifest.py` +
  `groundloop/mine/data/e2e_manifest.toml` — a git-versioned repo/issue/pr/SHA/oracle recipe; bulky data —
  logs, checkouts, the atlas.db — stays off-repo, regenerable from it); and an honest end-to-end funnel
  report (`render_e2e_funnel` in `groundloop/fixeval/report.py`) that grades match → localize → fix on the
  SAME cases, with **submit/bind always reported as mock, never scored as bound**.
- **The trim:** retired genuinely-dead `ndcg_at_k` / standalone `mrr()` / `success_at_k`
  (`eval/metrics.py`) and the orphaned `build_functional_negatives` (`synth/functional.py`) — both
  confirmed caller-free before deletion. The honesty/selective/abstention/negatives stack + the KB-as-eval
  arm are **quarantined** ("not exercised by any read" in `docs/evaluation.md`), **not deleted**.
- **Scope honored:** Tier B only (uniform full-end-to-end; no match-localize-only Tier A cases); no
  honest-refusal negatives; **not closing the loop** — this is measurement, not a real fix / live Gerrit.
- **`core/` + atlas schema zero-diff.**
- **OPEN — the gated-live follow-up (not done):** run `gloop mine --require-crash-log
  --require-merged-fix` over a broadened Android/native repo set → commit the populated manifest → build
  the atlas (off ext4) → run the end-to-end funnel read (`[proxy]`). Needs `gh` + the gateway + a built
  atlas, so it can't run hermetically — it's the next step, not done here. Spec/plan:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-e2e-eval-corpus-design.md`,
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-19-e2e-eval-corpus.md`.

### Localize — `--localize atlas_rerank` shipped as the Provisional-Core default (2026-07-19) ✅
Shipped **`--localize atlas_rerank`**: the plain FTS5 `AtlasIndex.retrieve` recall pool reordered by the rerank
LLM file-judge, composed via the same additive `pool_index` seam `cascade_judge` uses on `RerankLocalizeIndex`
— but with a plain `AtlasIndex` pool instead of the cascade, so it needs **no embedder at all** (unlike
`--localize rerank`, which fails closed without one). Commits: `1c32b35`/`4d2d442` (spec+plan),
`c87f7a5` (the arm), `b91ae58` (made it the run default), `f8ef049` (grade-run isolated-localize diagnostic
fix so `atlas_rerank` runs attribute correctly instead of falling through to a generic `atlas` label, + a
stale `--profile` help-string fix).
- **Made the production DEFAULT localize arm** (replaced `atlas`), in **both** `--profile core` and
  `--profile labs` — classified **Provisional-Core** (the existing governance tier: default-on on a fail-safe
  argument, before a `[production]` effectiveness read, reverting on debt), on the same admission logic as Bug
  Plan Mode.
- **The fail-safe argument (proven):** with no judge creds (`KLOOP_PRODUCE_API_KEY` unset) it returns the FTS5
  pool order **byte-identical to `--localize atlas`** (with no `KLOOP_REGISTRY` doc-bridge; a rank-1-preserving
  recall-superset with it) — a credential-less production run cannot regress, and it
  never fail-closes (no embedder dependency anywhere in the arm). `--localize atlas` stays the explicit
  opt-out / revert path. Cost while creds are present: ~$0.0014/case.
- **The one honest NEW failure mode (not covered by the fail-safe, unmeasured for this arm):** *with* judge
  creds, the LLM judge can rank the true file **below** where raw FTS5 had it — a `file@1` regression vs
  `atlas`.
- **Context:** `cascade_judge` stays the opt-in **higher-ceiling** Candidate (richer recall pool, best
  `[proxy]` file@1 0.245/file@5 0.469) but needs an embedder; `atlas_rerank` trades that ceiling for
  zero-embedder + the degrade-to-`atlas` floor, which is why it (not `cascade_judge`) is the default.
- **OPEN — the resolver is NOT done yet:** a `[proxy]` isolated `file@1` A/B comparing `atlas` vs
  `atlas_rerank` vs `cascade_judge` on the existing mine74 harness (n=108) — gated Type-2 (needs a live
  gateway + a real atlas + `--repos`), so it cannot run hermetically. Decision rule: `atlas_rerank file@1 ≥
  atlas` → keep the default (then a `[production]` GEI read is the path toward Core); `< atlas` → revert the
  default to `--localize atlas`. Docs updated (`capabilities.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `module-map.md`) to record
  `atlas_rerank` as Provisional-Core/unproven — **not** `[production]`-validated. Spec/plan:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-atlas-rerank-localize-design.md`,
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-19-atlas-rerank-localize.md`.

### First-principles review — Phase-2 structural cleanup complete, Cycle 4 = produce relocation+strip (2026-07-19) ✅
The 2026-07-18 aggressive first-principles review (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-first-principles-review.md`;
verdict: GroundLoop is honestly a **validated Stage-1 matcher + research lab, not a delivered closed loop**)
queued a 6-item Phase-2 menu; **all items are now shipped + pushed across 4 subagent-driven cycles.** Cycle 4
(just merged, `225f4eb`) is the deferred **produce *physical* relocation + strip**:
- **Relocated** the vendored CodeWiki doc-generator out of the product package: `groundloop/engines/produce/` → a
  **top-level `codewiki/`** package (56 live `.py`), pure `git mv` + `groundloop.engines.produce.*`→`codewiki.*`
  prefix-rewrite (symmetric diff, **no logic drift** in survivors).
- **Stripped ~30 reachability-dead files** — web app `src/fe/`, CodeWiki's own `mcp/` server (NOT the CBM you
  depend on), the standalone `codewiki` CLI (`cli/main.py`+`cli/commands/`), the copy-paste config lane, dead
  utils, `DocumentationGenerator.run()`, the guarded dead-HTML branch — anchored on a static reachability trace
  from the **only** build entry `CLIDocumentationGenerator.generate()`. **Net −6,628 LOC** (422 add / 7,050 del).
- `gloop produce` stays a thin **lazy bridge** (`cli/__init__.py:113`, function-local seam); the import contract's
  FORBIDDEN now guards product↛`codewiki` (**proven to bite** via a revert-clean sanity mutation); `pyproject.toml`
  packages both `groundloop*`+`codewiki*`; `codewiki/` is **self-contained** (no back-import into `groundloop`).
  `core/`+atlas schema **zero-diff**, suite **754 passed / 8 skipped**, ruff clean, final holistic review = clean
  merge gate. Spec/plan `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-19-produce-relocate-strip*.md`.
- **Live confirmation (2026-07-19, `[production]`-path):** the deferred gateway-gated follow-up **ran and PASSED**
  — a real `gloop produce` (live `deepseek-chat`) on a tiny 4-file repo executed the full 5-stage pipeline
  end-to-end (EXIT 0, 4m31s), emitting the complete output contract (`metadata.json`, non-empty
  `module_tree.json`, 4 per-module `.md` + overview, 30,970 chars of real doc content), and the atlas
  `load_wiki` loader **consumed it cleanly** (4 modules, 5 docs). The stripped generator is proven functional.
- **Gap found + fixed:** the run first failed with a misleading "requires the produce extra" error — the real
  cause was that `codewiki` (a NEW top-level package) wasn't registered in the venv's PEP-660 editable finder,
  so the `gloop` **entry point** (`sys.path[0]=.venv/bin`) couldn't import it (repo-root `python` masked this via
  CWD-on-path). **Task 3's "no re-sync needed" was verified from repo-root CWD and was wrong for the installed
  entry point.** Fix = `uv sync --extra dev --extra produce` regenerates the finder to include `codewiki`.
  `pyproject.toml` was already correct, so a fresh `pip install groundloop[produce]` is unaffected — only an
  **existing venv pulling this change must re-sync**.
- **Prior cycles (all merged+pushed):** C1 honest structural cleanup + produce dep/import/build externalization
  (`eb98cf1`); C2 KB 3-axis redesign → the `KnowledgePlaybook` self-improving crash-RCA system, KB **Dormant →
  Candidate** (`0c8b644`); C3 Core/Labs boundary → a CI-enforced import contract, 11 index arms + MockSkillRegistry
  + offline-grade tooling relocated out of product dirs (`80d2f92`).

### Localize recall — cascade→judge shipped + [proxy] WIN (2026-07-18) ✅
Shipped **`--localize cascade_judge`**: the recall-first cascade POOL reordered by the LLM file-judge, built as
an **additive `pool_index` seam** on `RerankLocalizeIndex` (default None ⇒ `--localize rerank` byte-identical).
Subagent-driven + a focused adversarial review (confirmed CodeWiki survives the pool k-cap; CLI↔grade_run
parity). Suite **731 green**, `core/`+schema zero-diff, merged to master (`43f9dae`+`bc32c6a`).
- **[proxy] WIN** (isolated file@k, n=108 mine74, baseline atlas, WITH `--repos`): **cascade_judge beats the
  prior best `rerank_cw_judge` at every k** — file@1 **0.206→0.245** (+0.039), file@3 0.347→0.437, file@5
  0.392→**0.469** — at ~equal cost ($0.148→$0.158). **Best localize file@1 to date.** Confirms the cascade→judge
  thesis (better recall pool → better judged result) and **redeems Phase 2** (the cascade is valuable as a judge
  pool source even though the literal tier alone was marginal). `docs/results-log.md` 2026-07-18.
- **Next:** cascade_judge is the **leading Candidate** for the `[production]` GEI file@k gate. Follow-ups:
  the CamelCase-atlas read, an atlas-snippet floor for `--repos`-less robustness, and the deferred A3
  match-regression check.

### Localize recall — Phase-2 literal-anchor cascade shipped + [proxy] read (2026-07-18) ✅
Shipped **`--localize cascade`** (Phase 2): a recall-first RRF union of the prose FTS floor + crash code-tokens +
literal anchors + optional bge-m3 semantic tier (`CascadeLocalizeIndex` + literal-anchor extractor + atlas
rarity gate). Subagent-driven with a **4-lens adversarial Workflow** that **caught a real non-regression
merge-blocker** (the prose floor was a fallback, not a union member → recall regression below `--localize
atlas`; fixed + regression test, gate tightened `max_files` 40→10). Opt-in Candidate, `core/`+schema zero-diff,
suite **728 green**, merged to master (`d3b8a3b..ed8820e`).
- **[proxy] read** (isolated file@k, n=108 mine74, **baseline** atlas-6-doc.db): the cascade beats the floor
  (0.075/0.244 → **0.098/0.308** file@1/@5) — BUT the **literal tier is marginal/mixed** (marginal file@1
  **−0.011**, file@5 +0.009); **the SEMANTIC tier is the lever, not the literal anchor** — this **partially
  disconfirms the design's central bet**. Baseline atlas ⇒ literal tier at partial strength (no CamelCase).
  `docs/results-log.md` 2026-07-18. **NOT promoted to default** — governance holds pending the [production] read.
- **Next (gated / open):** the CamelCase-atlas cascade read (full literal strength) + [production] GEI file@k +
  the deferred A3 match-regression = the promotion gate; and the **cascade-recall → rerank-judge** integration
  (cascade wins recall@5, judge wins file@1 at 0.212 — combine them). Open: keep the literal tier in the default
  cascade given its file@1 cost, or gate it?

### Localize recall — first-principles re-scope + Phase-1 mechanical fixes shipped (2026-07-18) ✅
A first-principles review ("is the Localize stage even necessary?") re-scoped the pending pool-widening plan.
Verdict (verified against code): Localize is necessary as a **concept**, **not** as a **hard gate** (`workflow.py:35`
hands fix the full worktree — the gate is a fix-adapter convention, relaxable without touching `core/`) and **not**
as a **file@1 target** (the loss is recall, not mis-ranking). Design = **Option B** recall-first cascade
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-17-localize-recall-cascade-design.md`). Shipped **Phase 1** (mechanical layer,
subagent-driven with adversarial review, 5 commits `084252a..5457e77`, **merged to master**): the `--localize
rerank` bge-m3 vector lane now **fails LOUD** instead of silently degrading to keyword-only (`return 2`/raise on a
missing embedder; per-case embed failures counted into `manifest.localize_embed_failures`), the CamelCase splitter
is shared (`engines/atlas/tokenize.py`, applied query-side with a match-noise filter caught in review) and an
opt-in `KLOOP_INDEX_CAMELCASE` splits identifiers at index time (default OFF = byte-identical). `core/` +
atlas-schema **zero-diff**; full suite **718 green**, ruff clean.
- **A1 `[proxy]` read** (isolated file@k, n=108 `mine74`, `atlas-6-doc.db`, live bge-m3): the vector lane
  **provably fires** — `atlas` (floor) 0.075/0.244 → `rerank_pool` (lane ON) 0.084/**0.267** (file@1/file@5); a
  **modest** standalone lift — the judge/literal/CamelCase tiers are the real levers. `docs/results-log.md` 2026-07-18.
  A1's win is **correctness**: a rerank scorecard can no longer silently reflect a dead vector lane.
- **Next (deferred, gated):** Phase 2 (literal-anchor cascade + RRF union + abstain-on-no-anchor), Phase 3
  (soft-gate fix: `locations` as seeds + CBM expansion), the benchmark re-point (`bug_kind` split + `localize_hit`),
  and the `[production]` GEI localize file@k read (lane ON) + the A3 CamelCase-atlas rebuild + match-regression —
  the Candidate→Core promotion gate.

### CodeWiki + CBM in localize & fix — full enablement + live A/B (2026-07-16/17) ✅
Fully enabled the two under-used code-understanding assets in the read-stages: **CodeWiki** (per-module LLM
docs) + **CBM** (code-graph) now feed the **localize reranker** (`--localize rerank` — a grounded LLM
file-judge over a CodeWiki/CBM-enriched hybrid pool) and the **fix prompt** (`--fix-context {codewiki,cbm}`).
Subagent-driven build (reranker, live `CBMLiveGraph` facade, doc→source `entity_map` bridge + `gloop bridge`,
fix-context injection, per-case `@base=fix^` checkout, miner `fix_patch`+`required_apis`), then a live A/B on a
new 6-repo doc atlas — all opt-in **Candidates**, `core/`+atlas-schema **zero-diff**.
- **Substrate:** `atlas-6-doc.db` (6 repos, 96,654 units incl. **9,665 doc units**; `atlas-9.db` had **0**) +
  per-repo `entity_map.json` + `mine74` (108 live-`gh` cases / **96 fix-gradeable** with real diffs+`required_apis`).
  Built off ext4.
- **cameraview engine bugfix (`1277e9f`):** CodeWiki `produce` crashed (KeyError, aborting a whole repo → 0 md)
  on a **name-colliding module tree** (a `video_encoding` child under a `video_encoding` parent) — the tree
  walkers descended into `children` by name-value, not index. Fixed in all 3 walkers + a hermetic regression
  test; cameraview **0→52 md**.
- **LOCALIZE A/B `[proxy]`** (isolated ceiling on the oracle repo, **prose-ticket regime**, n=108): FTS5 floor
  **file@1 0.075 → 0.212** (+0.137, 2.8×; file@5 0.235→0.384). The **LLM judge is the bigger lever (+0.083)**;
  **CodeWiki-under-judge +0.056** (pool+context *entangled*, one `entity_map` toggle); **CBM marginal (+0.038,
  within noise**, 26-case subset). ~$0.0014/case. Hybrid pool + CodeWiki-in-pool do ≈0 at rank-1 *without* the
  judge → recall-alone doesn't move rank-1; the grounded reorder does.
- **FIX A/B `[proxy]`** (forced oracle repo + forced oracle localization so only context varies, n=29): **no
  measurable fix-context effect** (resolved 1/29 vs 0/29; **CBM never fired** — 0-signal prose tickets ⇒
  CodeWiki-only; underpowered). The plan fixer correctly **abstains, not fabricates**. Fix effectiveness is
  blocked on a **crash-with-fix substrate**, not context — consistent with the KB re-verdict below.
- **Adversarially verified** (4-lens refutation workflow, all **CAVEATED** — numbers reproduce, no measurement
  bug): caught the isolated-ceiling framing, the CodeWiki pool+context entanglement, judge-is-the-bigger-lever,
  the prose-regime confound, CBM-never-fired-in-fix, and the fix underpowering — all folded into the record.
- **Governance (`capabilities.md`):** `--localize rerank` (+CodeWiki, judge) → promotion **Candidate** (first
  `[proxy]` file@1 lever); gate = a **`[production]` crash-ticket `file@1`** read + an e2e (match-gated)
  confirmation. `--localize +CBM` and `--fix-context {codewiki,cbm}` stay **OFF** (no measurable benefit /
  untested).
- **Docs:** `results-log.md` 2026-07-16 entry (`ee6440b`) · design-logic
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-localize-fix-design-logic.md` (`9335421`) · module/data-flow map
  `docs/data-flow.md` + CLAUDE.md pointer (`62f6035`). Suite **704 passed / 8 skipped, ruff clean.**

### Production-Core defaults + loop closure — 11-task branch (2026-07-13) ✅
Branch `prod-core-defaults-loop-closure` (subagent-driven, 11 tasks). Promotes the fix default, closes the
feedback loop's data plane + reporting edge on the dev box, and prunes the production surface — **plumbing +
governance, NOT a new efficacy read** (no new `[proxy]`/`[production]` numbers).
- **Bug Plan Mode → Provisional-Core `gloop run` default:** `--fixer plan` (the `PlanningFixEngine`) is now the
  default (choices `canned|model|plan`, + a `--max-replan` flag; the fail-closed guard covers `model` **and**
  `plan`); it now re-gates its *executed* diff against the localize candidate set (abstains if out-of-scope) —
  end-to-end anti-leak. **Proven merit = safety** (`fabrication_rate = 0.0`, abstains not fabricates);
  **effectiveness is production-gated** — `resolved_rate` was never gradeable. A new governance state
  **Provisional-Core** is written into [`capabilities.md`](capabilities.md): default-on on a *fail-safe*
  mechanism + a charter-aligned safety argument, resolving to Core-or-revert on the next instrumented
  `[production]` run.
- **Data plane closed:** a `RecordingExtractor` sidecar captures the loop's `signals`; the run-record persists
  `signals`/`cost_usd`/`tokens`/`model_calls`/`fixer`; each batch writes a provenance `manifest.json` (atlas
  identity + model pins + affinity hash + `change_sink=mock` + timestamp). Plan/patch primitives relocated
  `fixeval/` → `groundloop/fix/` (Core decoupled from Dev-Labs).
- **Reporting edge closed:** grade-run cards carry per-case predicted/oracle repo + signals + cost + fixer;
  `grade-run --compare <prev-card>` → a per-stage improved/flat/regressed verdict + a `.compare.json` sibling;
  reporting-only promotion-eligibility notes (fire for `--fixer plan` runs with gradeable resolution).
- **Surface pruning:** a `KLOOP_DEV` dev-gate rejects `--index`/`--fixer canned`/`--case` in production (the
  Type-1 suite arms `KLOOP_DEV=1` via an autouse fixture); the `--repos` guard was hardened from presence-only
  to verifying catalog snapshots actually exist.
- **Open follow-up:** the deferred **`[production]` `resolved_rate` A/B (plan vs model)** is what resolves Bug
  Plan Mode's Provisional-Core status (grade-run emits the promotion note). Spec/plan:
  `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-13-production-core-defaults-and-loop-closure*.md`. **608 passed / 7
  skipped, ruff clean, `core/` + atlas schema zero-diff.**

### KB fair-eval Phase 1 — harness fix + re-verdict (2026-07-13) ✅
The KB's "Archived null" was measured on the wrong outcome. Phase 1 (branch `kb-fair-eval-phase1`,
subagent-driven, 2-stage-reviewed): synth now plants a headroom-clean `required_api` (named in the skill
guidance) into 6 crash classes → `resolved_rate` is **gradeable for the first time** (the miner hard-coded
`required_apis=[]` and synth omitted it — it was undefined loop-wide); + `gloop fixeval --skills-inject
fix-only` (KB into the fix prompt only, not the localize query). Live A/B (34-case gradeable slice, `--fixer
direct`, ~$0.10): **harness fix validated** (`fix-only` provably localize-invariant — `none`=`kb·fix-only`
file@1 0.157); **confound confirmed** (skills in the localize query cost **Δ−0.10** file@1); but
**`resolved_rate` INCONCLUSIVE** (0 floor — the synthetic log is disconnected from the real fix, so nothing
resolves; synth is the wrong substrate for resolution). Verdict: the Archived null is **discredited** but the
KB is **unproven** → reclassified **Archived → Candidate**. **Phase-2 scout (same day)**: the OSS proxy fleet
has only **~7–15** genuine crash-with-fix cases (features/UI dominate, not AAOS crashes) — too few to test the
KB. Every dev-box substrate is exhausted (synth: 0 resolution; OSS-real: ~no crashes), so the KB verdict is
**production-gated** — it needs real AAOS crash+fix tickets; the Phase 2 spec now stands as a production-side
task. Detail: `results-log.md` 2026-07-13. **572 passed / 7 skipped, ruff clean.**

### Production-Core / Dev-Labs governance + `gloop run` default re-point (2026-07-12) ✅
Adopted the **Production Core + Dev Labs** model and applied it. New [`capabilities.md`](capabilities.md):
every capability classified **Core / Candidate / Dev-Labs-Infra / Fixture / Archived** with evidence
(seeded by an evidence-graded, adversarially-verified sweep of the whole tree). Headline: the real
Production Core is ~a dozen pieces; the alternative matchers + fix engines are `[proxy]`-only **Candidate**;
the whole KB track is **Archived** on a measured null (0/60 claims; raw Skills Δ−0.14). Biggest finding —
the default `gloop run` was a **hermetic toy end-to-end** (canned fixer + empty `MockEstate` + mock
JIRA/Gerrit + `flood`). **Re-pointed the composition-root defaults** (`cli/__init__.py`, no `core/` edit):
match `flood`→`component` (auto-affinity via `--affinity`/`KLOOP_AFFINITY`, loud flood fallback), fixer
`canned`→`model`, **fail-closed** when `--fixer model` lacks creds or `--repos` (no more silent `CannedModel`
degrade). Hermetic Type-1 runs now select `--fixer canned` explicitly. Also corrected a doc mislabel: the
`[production]` localize (7/10 file@5) ran **plain FTS5 `AtlasIndex.retrieve`**, not bge-m3+qwen (eval-only).
**566 passed / 7 skipped, ruff clean.** Remaining Core gaps (net-new builds): live JIRA `IssueSource` +
live Gerrit `ChangeSink` — the traceable JIRA↔commit chain is still mocked at the ends.

### Self-scoring pipeline — `gloop run` batch + `gloop grade-run` (2026-07-11) ✅ MERGED to master
Fixes the *measurement* failures the first e2e run exposed (localize misread as 0/10; an 8-vs-7 hand-tally).
`gloop run` now persists the `RunRecord` it used to discard (batch mode over a dataset, oracle-blind) + `--repos`
(CheckoutEstate) / `--fixer {canned,model}` knobs; `gloop grade-run` is an offline per-stage scorecard — match
`recall@1/@3/@5`, localize **as-run** (on chosen) + **isolated** (on oracle repo = the "7/10 not 0/10"
auto-correction), fix `resolved_strict`/`fabrication` **or** honest `UNGRADEABLE(no_source)`, a `by_bug_kind`
split, and a generated per-case markdown table. **Zero `core/` edits** (the frozen `RunRecord` already carried
`ranked`/`locations`/`patch`); reuses `eval`/`fixeval` machinery (`load_cases`, `load_eval_oracle`,
`recall_at_k`, `FixRecord`, `grade_fix_all`, `patch_applies`). New units: `groundloop/run/{record,batch,grade_run,
report}.py` + additive `RecordingEstate`/`CheckoutEstate`. Leak-honest (red-tested invariants 7–8: run-record
oracle-free, `grade_run` sole oracle reader). 8 tasks, **566 passed / 7 skipped, ruff clean**. Spec/plan:
`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-11-self-scoring-pipeline*.md`; runbook `docs/production-guide.md` §8.
*Process note:* Tasks 1–3 ran subagent-driven with 2-stage review; Task 4's implementer subagent emitted an
anomalous (self-generated, non-injected — verified via its transcript) jailbreak-pattern output and did nothing,
so Tasks 4–8 were completed in the main context. No compromise; config/repo clean.

### First end-to-end production run — 10 functional GEI cases (2026-07-11) ✅ first efficacy read
The **first full 8-stage `gloop run`** on real production GEI data (10 functional cases, `component` match arm,
`component_affinity.json` mined from **1,169 JIRA↔Gerrit oracle pairs**, real **19-repo / 126,919-unit** atlas
built with the **bge-m3** embedder + **qwen3p6-27b** CodeWiki producer — both *index-build-time*, not query-time).
This is the production scoreboard the component-routing pivot was built for. **Match recall@1 7/10 `[production]`** by the per-case table (⚠ the run summary reported 8/10 — a
count-reconciliation flag: 2 root causes but **3** missed cases `13363`/`14905`/`8185`; confirm against the raw
scorecard). **Localize 7/10 file@5, 1/10 file@1 `[production]`** — a **measurement correction**: an earlier "localize 0/10"
was misreading the fix stage's *fabricated* file. Localize runs `AtlasIndex.retrieve` = **plain FTS5 keyword
search** over symbol units (the bge-m3 vector / qwen-rerank paths are eval-only arms, never wired into
`run_ticket`) — so *keyword localize alone* already gets 7/10 file@5 on production. **Fix 0/10 but ungraded `[production]`** — an **empty-worktree** artifact (only `XCIPadMediaService` checked out
under `$GL_DATA/repos/`), not a fix-stage failure. Root causes: match misses = label≠owner (`13363`
Bluetooth→cluster) + CarPlay Core-vs-Integration near-tie (0.005 gap < base RRF ≤0.017); localize misses =
coverage gap (`8185` `CpAccessibilityManager.kt` not indexed) + pool recall (`14905`/`4240`). **Highest-value
unblock = check out the 4 owner repos** so fix becomes gradeable (production-side). Detail:
`docs/results-log.md`. Dev-box follow-ups (gated on the 406): CarPlay semantic
tiebreak, a `component`-override text signal for label≠owner, per-file localize aggregation.

### Component-routing match arm — MERGED to master (2026-07-10); proxy mechanism check ✅
Production feedback on the real 19-repo GEI atlas redirected the functional-bug track: ticket-text matching is
size-biased (recall@1 **0.10 `[production]`**), and an empirical **JIRA component→repo affinity prior** is the dominant Stage-1
lever (**0.10 → 0.50** recall@1, 0.90 recall@3 `[production]`, zero token cost). This **reconciles the "component unusable"
call below** — that was true for *naive* skills lookup (repo-name keys vs functional-area component values,
0/10 `[production]`); an **empirically-derived** affinity map (learned from the JIRA↔Gerrit oracle) bridges the vocabulary.
Built loop-blind + frozen-safe: `ComponentAffinity` (raw counts + leave-one-out), `gloop mine-affinity`
(offline miner), `ComponentExtractor`/`ComponentPriorIndex` (carry the component through the `Signals` seam,
**strip before the base**, **RRF-rank-fused** so it's scale-invariant to the base's score magnitude),
`gloop funceval --affinity/--loo` + `gloop run --match-arm
{flood,routing,component}`. **Leak-honest:** runtime reads only `Ticket.component` (loop-blind); the eval avoids
train/test leak via **leave-one-out** (grader-side, subtract the case's own contribution). Subagent-driven,
**11 commits, 547 passed / ruff clean, `core/`+atlas-schema+`rank_repos`+`owner_tokens.py`+`repo_routing.py`+
`mine/` zero-diff**, two-stage review per batch + final holistic review (READY TO MERGE; caught 3 plan-fixture
slips). **Proxy mechanism check** (`docs/results-log.md`): the prior lifts the FTS
base to **component recall@1 0.49 / recall@3 0.92** (flood 0.32/0.58) `[proxy]` — the same SHAPE as the measured
production `comp+fusion` (~0.50/0.90) `[production]`: the prior narrows to top-3, within-component disambiguation is the gap.
LOO is unit-proven load-bearing on rare pairs and correctly-negligible on well-populated ones. **Real efficacy
= production** (run the real affinity build +
406-case LOO eval on the GEI corpus; then the gated Step-3 `XCUSBMediaService` index + Step-4 CarPlay).
- Spec/plan: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-10-component-routing-match*.md`.

### Functional-bug matching arm (the "second problem") — MERGED to master (2026-07-10); live A/B ✅
The successor to v2: attribute **no-crash functional bugs** (wrong UI text, audio, CarPlay/projection) to the
owning repo when there is no crash frame. Originally text-primary (JIRA `component` looked unusable via naive
skills lookup — **later superseded**: the empirical component-affinity prior above is the dominant signal on
real GEI data; see the component-routing entry). A frozen-safe `(extractor, index)` bolt-on: `FunctionalTextExtractor`
finally uses `ticket.summary`+description (v2 ignored summary), carrying prose through the frozen `Signals` seam as
a reserved `symbols[0]` slot; `FunctionalTextIndex` = bge-m3 max-cosine over a **lightweight per-repo text profile**
(README+manifest+module ids; `gloop build-textprofile`, no 12 GB atlas rebuild) ⊕ optional log-FTS RRF; abstain via
the reused `decide()`+`TAU_FUNC`. A per-case **`dispatch`** arm routes crash-anchor→v2 `FaultRoutingIndex`,
prose-only→functional (Signals-only discriminator; `fault_scale` bridges the two score scales). Offline `bug_kind`
(crash|functional) oracle field + `by_bug_kind` scorecard split + `gloop funceval` + `gloop synth --mode functional`
(UI-text/audio/CarPlay + honest-refusal negatives). Subagent-driven, **28 commits, 530 passed / ruff clean, `core/`
+ atlas schema + gated `rank_repos`/`owner_tokens.py`/`repo_routing.py`/`mine/` zero-diff**, per-task spec+quality
review + final holistic review — caught **6 real defects** (retrieve no-op, walk-prune, dispatch tau-scale over-abstain,
audio-`.so` false signal, and the **ticket-text owner-slug leak** that would have let `flood` cheat).
- **Live A/B (`docs/results-log.md`):** 212 functional + 196 crash over `atlas-9.db`.
  **Functional recall@1: flood 0.32 → functional/dispatch 0.68 `[proxy]`** (~2.1×; Φ₁ +0.30 → +0.39); the v2 crash arms
  (`faultslice`/`routing`) correctly **abstain** on no-crash tickets (0.01, coverage 0.00 `[proxy]`) — reproducing + fixing the
  GEI `8/10 no_fault` `[production]` failure mode. **Crash: `dispatch` 0.94 == `routing` 0.94 `[proxy]`, no regression.** One `dispatch` arm =
  **0.94 crash + 0.68 functional** `[proxy]`. Develop-against-feedback: the first run's profile-build timeout (partial 4/9 repos
  → false 0.26 `[proxy]`) was fixed by bounding profile chunks, then rebuilt 9/9 → valid 0.68 `[proxy]`.
- GEI/406 oracle is **production-only** (proxy regresses, production scores — see [environments.md](environments.md)).
- Deferred: functional honest-refusal negatives folded into the A/B dataset; per-`functional_class` breakdown.
- Spec/plan: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-10-functional-bug-match*.md`.

### Android Log Match v2 — fault-localization + attribution — MERGED to master (2026-07-09); live A/B ✅
Isolate the true fault site from a long full-system logcat and attribute it to the owning repo, with
fault-localization and attribution scored **separately**. Built toward the real ecarx/gkui estate, validated
on an **unscrubbed OSS proxy** (package namespaces are legitimate owner signal there). Deterministic pipeline
(no gateway): `logcat_parse` → `frame_norm` → `fault_extract` (anchors + pid/tid scope + confidence →
`FaultRecord`) → `fault_signals` (tight `Signals`) → Phase-1 `faultslice` (reuse `rank_repos`) / Phase-2
`FaultRoutingIndex` (production-known prefix/SONAME routing + RRF). New `gloop synth --mode faultlog`
(clean|hard decoys + fault-locus oracle) and `gloop faulteval` (3-arm A/B + `fault_localization` metric).
Subagent-driven, **18 commits, 494 passed / ruff clean, `core/` + atlas schema + gated `rank_repos`/
`owner_tokens.py`/`mine/` zero-diff**, per-task spec+quality review (caught 3 real bugs: timestamp swap,
`fault_file` basename collision, soname-boundary misclassification) + a final holistic review (READY TO MERGE).
- **Live A/B (`docs/results-log.md`):** 196-case faultlog over `atlas-9.db`.
  **Attribution recall@1: flood 0.48 → faultslice 0.86 → routing 0.94 `[proxy]`** (tight extraction ~doubles it).
  **Robustness:** under hard decoys the flood baseline **drops 0.48→0.32 `[proxy]`** while faultslice/routing are
  **unchanged** (decoy-immune). **Localization:** `frame@1=0.88` / `frame@5=0.95` `[proxy]`. Log-quality audit:
  **0/187 owner-leak** in clean noise (honest), needle at 25–75% depth, 196/196 oracle integrity.
- Deferred (sanctioned): confidence-weighted RRF, the `no_fault=9` audio-underrun class (non-fatal → the
  second-problem track), UI-string / ticket-text matching (the deferred **second problem**).
- Spec/plan: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-09-android-log-match-v2*.md`.

### GL-M0 — walking skeleton
Deterministic ticket → repo → fix → bind loop over the mock adapters + `TokenIndex` stub + offline
grader. Hermetic vertical slice green.

### GL-M1 — real index (consume + build)  ·  17 tasks, final review PASS
Migrated the full index engine from knowledgeLoop behind the ports:
- `engines/atlas` (Store — schema unchanged; chunk/symbol_source/source_probe; embed/retrieve/registry;
  index_repo/build_units), `engines/lore` (CBM graph client/nodes/forward, bridge/schema NodeRecord,
  deploy launch-spec, wiki loader; `_resolve_repo_head` extracted — `server.py` NOT migrated),
  `engines/produce` (CodeWiki generation, 86 files).
- `AtlasIndex` (CodeIndex port) = FTS5 unit-membership `rank_repos` over a real atlas.db; discriminates
  the owner from hard negatives (hermetic-tested on a hand-built fixture db).
- CLI: `gloop index` (build atlas.db from a registry), `gloop produce` (wiki), `gloop doctor`
  (readiness). `gloop run --index-db` swaps `AtlasIndex` for `TokenIndex` at the composition root —
  `core/` untouched.
- Reuse contract honored: `embed_model` pinned `bge-m3`; store schema migrated unchanged.
- CBM packaging: **Level-1 default hard dep** (`mcp` + `codebase-memory-mcp==0.8.1` + produce stack in
  base `[project.dependencies]`; launched as the installed binary, not `uvx`).
- Detail: `docs/build-setup.md`.

### Type-2 track — SP1 → SP3 (honest-refusal negatives + fix-loop eval + dev-experience KB)  ·  COMPLETE
The four-sub-project Type-2 extension (design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-05-type2-negatives-fixloop-kb-design.md`),
all shipped to master, `core/` untouched, hermetic + gated surfaces:
- **SP1a/SP1b** — honest-refusal **negatives** (four classes; Φ_c + `abstention_recall_oof`; per-arm τ;
  leak-tight opaque `case_id`; closed-loop reject). Grounded refusal is now a real Stage-1 number.
- **SP2** — the downstream **fix/RCA loop + eval** (`groundloop/fixeval/`): `FixEvalRunner` drives
  localize→propose-patch directly (never the frozen `run_ticket`); `grade_fix_all` = `file_recall@k` +
  `patch_applies` + `required_api_pass_rate` + advisory `resolved_rate` + whole-loop **`fabrication_rate`**;
  `gloop fixeval` / `compare`.
- **SP3** — the dev-experience **KB as a measured arm** (`groundloop/skills/` + `MockSkillRegistry`,
  real-data seed): `gloop fixeval --skills {none,mock}` injects `render_skills()` playbooks post-match on
  `ModelPatchEngine`; graded by the two-sided `accept` gate (Δfile_recall POS + Δfabrication_rate honesty);
  declarative-compiled predicates; migration guide + non-vacuous parity self-test (`docs/fix-loop.md`).
- Detail: `docs/evaluation.md` (§6.4 fix-stage arm), `docs/fix-loop.md`.

### Plan-format fix stage — MERGED to master + pushed (2026-07-07); live A/B RUN ✅
Turns the fix stage into a grounded **plan-then-act** loop: a two-phase `PlanningFixEngine`
(plan → oracle-blind in-world gate → bounded re-plan → abstain → execute) behind
`gloop fixeval --fixer plan`. Shipped hermetically — 16 commits, full suite **366 passed / 7 skipped**,
ruff clean, `core/` + atlas schema **zero-diff**, per-phase spec+quality review + a final holistic review:
- **resolved_rate hardening** — `resolved_rate_strict` (patch's OWN `touched_files` ∩ `expected_files`;
  required APIs on non-comment code lines), reported beside the old proxy for comparability.
- **PlanningFixEngine** + `RepairPlan` + tolerant parser + the **anti-leak** in-world gate
  (scope-checked BEFORE any disk read; rejects `..`/absolute paths; never reads the oracle).
- **Grounded grader** — `plan_groundedness` (oracle-blind, recorded at run time) + `plan_target_recall@1/5`
  + `plan_api_match` (offline); plan archive (`plan.json` + `fired_skills` + outcome, capture-only).
- **KB validation surface** — `--skills distilled` arm + `accept_grounded` two-sided gate
  (POS = Δplan_target_recall@1 / Δresolved_rate_strict > 0; HONESTY = Δfabrication ≤ 0 ∧ Δgroundedness ≥ 0)
  to validate **raw + distilled** KB knowledge under `--fixer plan`.
- Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-07-plan-format-fix-stage-design.md` · plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-07-plan-format-fix-stage.md`.
- **Merged + a follow-on FTS5 fix** (`_fts_query` now quotes leaf tokens so a KB Localize hint containing
  `NOT` no longer crashes matching/localize — this had crashed the earlier kb-ab live run).
- **Live A/B RUN (Phase 3, `docs/results-log.md`):** 56-case correct-match
  slice (oboe 25 + dlt-daemon 19 positives + 12 neg), ext4-staged (Finding 10), 4 arms + 2 compares.
  **Q1 engine (direct vs plan):** a *structural* tie — `file_recall@1` is fixer-invariant (0.189 both `[proxy]`,
  localize precedes fix) and the grounded axis is uncomparable (direct emits no plan → Δ=None). The plan
  arm produces the intended grounded artifact (`plan_target_recall@1` 0.48 / `@5` 0.68, groundedness 0.56,
  fabrication 0.0 `[proxy]`) that `direct` lacks, but its *executed patches* don't apply on synth (`apply_rate`
  1.0→0.0 `[proxy]`) and resolution is ungradeable (no `required_apis`) — so **plan-vs-direct on resolution stays
  open**, blocked on a `required_apis`-bearing slice, not the plan format. **Q2 KB-under-plan:** raw KB
  **hurts** — `plan_target_recall@1` **plan/none 0.48 > placebo 0.36 > kb 0.22** (Δ kb-vs-placebo −0.14) `[proxy]`,
  an independent fresh-run reproduction of the claim-KB §8 verdict (messy Skills injected wholesale
  degrade the planner). Fabrication 0.0 all arms `[proxy]`.

### Claim-centric distilled KB — MERGED to master (2026-07-07); live preview ✅, full efficacy pending
> **Vocabulary correction (2026-07-14, branch `skill-to-knowledge-rename`):** the distilled unit `Claim` was
> renamed **`Knowledge`** (`--claims`→`--knowledge`, `kb/claim.py`→`kb/knowledge.py`, `claims.json`→
> `knowledge.json`); a `Skill` is now **input-only** (raw feedstock, never a KB output); **Lane A** (the
> reversed *harvest → distill* lane that minted a Skill as output — `kb/harvest/`, `kb/distill/`, its
> `gloop` CLI driver, the `--skills distilled` arm and its `.toml` artifact) was **removed**; and `gloop
> kb-ab` was retargeted to gate on **Knowledge**. This is a naming + surface correction only — **no efficacy
> change**; the KB stays
> **Candidate/unproven**. The historical `[proxy]` numbers below are unchanged.

Inverts the KB onto atomic grounded **claims** (design/plan: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-07-
claim-centric-distilled-kb*.md`): Skills are feedstock; `kb-extract` (LLM proposes → ground-check disposes)
→ `--claims` arm injects only tier-qualifying claims into the plan → `kb-attribute` (screen → LOFO-confirm
vs placebo → per-claim promote/retire). Phases A–C shipped subagent-driven — **15 commits, 449 tests, `core/`
+ atlas schema zero-diff**, per-phase spec+quality review + final holistic review (caught + fixed: porous
grounding, redundant live-eval spend, an uncaught promotion-gate regression, the `--claims-store` gap).
- **Live preview (2026-07-07, `docs/results-log.md`):** the full path runs on real
  infra — `kb-extract` minted **60 grounded candidate claims** from the 12 Skills (ground-check correctly
  dropped ~14 templated/unindexed refs = "LLM proposes, gate disposes" validated). The fix-eval efficacy
  numbers were zero `[proxy]` on a 4–8-case slice, but for **artifacts** (match size-bias mispredicting the slice's
  repo; only 1 repo staged on ext4 → wholesale abstain; synth cases lack `required_apis`) — a plumbing
  validation, not an efficacy verdict. One honesty hint: `plan` abstained where `direct` fabricated.
- **First efficacy read (Phase D lite, ~7.5 min via the ext4 fix):** on a correct-match slice
  (oboe + dlt-daemon), the raw **candidate** claims do NOT beat placebo (`plan_target_recall@1`: none 0.625,
  claims 0.50, placebo 0.50; fabrication 0 all `[proxy]`) — consistent with the design (unvalidated claims aren't
  trusted wholesale). `kb-attribute` (the retain-loop) timed out under the 15-min cap, so no tiers promoted.
- **Full Phase D verdict (§8, ~2 h unbounded, 2 disjoint windows):** the retain-loop validated **0** of the
  60 candidates (all `lofo_delta=0`, none load-bearing; 4 retired) → the empty validated set = no-injection,
  and *no-injection (0.51) beats placebo (0.37) beats the raw 12 Skills (0.22)* on `plan_target_recall@1` `[proxy]` —
  the messy Skills injected wholesale HURT the planner. Empirical vindication of the distill-first /
  distrust-unverified design. Detail: `docs/results-log.md` §8.

### Testing environment
- **Type-1 (hermetic)** — `tests/conftest.py` (shared fixtures: `case`, `harness`, `atlas_harness`,
  prebuilt atlas.db, canned model) + `tests/test_invariants.py` (the anti-leak §2.3 red-tests — the
  design already honored them; these lock it in). **Suite: 55 passed / 3 skipped, ruff clean.**
- **Type-2 (live eval) — prepped + de-risked** (`.env` gitignored / `.env.example` /
  `/mnt/x/code/corpora/atlas.toml` / `docs/build-setup.md`):
  - ✅ **CBM validated live** on android-gpuimage-plus: 31,552 nodes / 41,191 edges, symbols in 3.3s.
  - ✅ **produce validated live** (deepseek-chat) → wiki generated; the pydantic-ai 1.x→2.x compat
    shim WORKS end-to-end (the M1 "latent risk" is now cleared). The `gloop produce` model default is
    now **`deepseek-chat`** (was `gpt-4o-mini` — unusable here: the gateway has no OpenAI backend).
  - ✅ Fixed: CBM launches the bare `codebase-memory-mcp` binary, so `.venv/bin` must be on `PATH`
    (now exported in `.env`).
  - ✅ **Test 2 (Type-2) live acceptance GREEN (2026-07-05):** both gated `tests/e2e/` tests pass live
    (`test_index_build_live` = produce→CBM→bge-m3 embed→atlas.db, 2:13; `test_produce_live` = wiki gen).
    First-ever execution surfaced + fixed two issues: a **missing `groundloop/cli/__main__.py`** (the
    tests invoke `python -m groundloop.cli`, which had no runnable entry) and the produce smoke's fragile
    asserts (retargeted to produce's real deliverable — `metadata.json` + a per-module `*.md`; `overview.md`
    / a non-empty `module_tree.json` are not reliably emitted for tiny repos).

## Current blocker — CLEARED ✅ (2026-07-05)
The pinned `bge-m3` embedding host is **back UP** — re-checked 2026-07-05: `/embeddings` → HTTP `200`,
returns a valid 1024-dim non-zero vector. The prior `000`/hung state (GPU/Ollama backend down) is
resolved. **No open blocker.** The full `gloop index` build (produce → CBM → embed → atlas.db) and the
2 gated live tests (`tests/e2e/`) are now unblocked. `deepseek-chat` (produce LLM) remains up.
Gate check (prints `200` when healthy): see `docs/build-setup.md` → "Embedding-host gate".

## Next steps
1. **Now unblocked (bge-m3 up 2026-07-05) — run the GL-M1 live acceptance:** `gloop produce` +
   `gloop index` over `/mnt/x/code/corpora/atlas.toml` → build `~/.groundloop/atlas.db`; `gloop doctor`;
   then run the gated live tests (`tests/e2e/`) with `KLOOP_EMBED_API_KEY` + `KLOOP_CBM_READY=1` +
   `KLOOP_PRODUCE_READY=1`. Runbook: `docs/build-setup.md`.
2. **Symbol filtering** before scaling the fleet — android-gpuimage-plus yields ~31k symbols because it
   vendors ffmpeg headers; drop vendored `ffmpeg/**` to cut embedding cost + noise. (Small follow-up.)
3. **Grow the eval fleet** — uncomment `libxcam` / `ndk-samples` in `corpora/atlas.toml`; a meaningful
   Stage-1 match needs several confusable repos so a `1/N` guess scores far below a real match.
4. **Resolve Bug Plan Mode's Provisional-Core status — the deferred `[production]` `resolved_rate` A/B (plan
   vs model).** The real fixer is now the `gloop run` default (2026-07-12 `--fixer model`; 2026-07-13 → the
   Provisional-Core `--fixer plan`), so the *wiring* is done; the open follow-up is the instrumented
   `[production]` run that measures `resolved_rate` (grade-run emits the promotion note) → confirm Bug Plan
   Mode into Core or revert to `--fixer model`. Still-open Core builds: an ANN vector index, live JIRA/Gerrit
   adapters, Tier-2/3 grading. *(`gloop mine` + the `gloop run` real-fixer default have since shipped — no
   longer next steps.)*
5. **Resolve `--localize rerank`'s Candidate status — the `[production]` crash-ticket localize `file@1` read.**
   The `[proxy]` win (CodeWiki-under-judge +0.056 file@1, 2.8× overall) is an *isolated ceiling on prose OSS
   tickets*; the promotion gate is a `[production]` GEI **crash-ticket** read (where code-token candidate-gen,
   not the prose fallback, drives the reranker pool) **+** an e2e (match-gated) confirmation. Sub-tasks: a
   disentangle-CodeWiki arm (`judge + doc→source pool, no wiki-context`); and a **crash-with-fix substrate** so
   the fix-context question (CBM in fix is genuinely untested — it never fired on signal-less tickets) becomes
   answerable at all. Detail: `docs/data-flow.md`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-localize-fix-design-logic.md`.
6. **Resolve `--localize atlas_rerank`'s Provisional-Core status — the `[proxy]` isolated `file@1` A/B, not yet
   run.** `atlas_rerank` is now the `gloop run` localize default (2026-07-19), admitted Provisional-Core on the
   fail-safe argument alone (degrades byte-identical to `--localize atlas` without judge creds); the
   *effectiveness* half is open. Next step: the isolated `file@1` comparison of `atlas` vs `atlas_rerank` vs
   `cascade_judge` on the mine74 harness (n=108, gated Type-2 — needs a live gateway + a real atlas + `--repos`).
   Decision rule: `atlas_rerank file@1 ≥ atlas` → keep the default, then chase a `[production]` GEI read toward
   Core; `< atlas` → revert the default to `--localize atlas`.
7. **Run the realistic e2e eval corpus build + first funnel read (gated, not done).** The hermetic machinery
   (crash-log + merged-fix mine filter, committed manifest, honest funnel report) shipped 2026-07-19; the open
   step is `gloop mine --require-crash-log --require-merged-fix` over a broadened Android/native repo set →
   commit the populated manifest → build the atlas (off ext4) → run the end-to-end funnel (`[proxy]`). Needs
   `gh` + the gateway + a built atlas, so it isn't hermetic — run by the user, not a merge gate.
8. **Run the `render_e2e_funnel` read over the 3 authored Tier-B cases (gated, not done).** The 3
   `[authored]` cases (`groundloop/mine/data/authored/`, 2026-07-20) are validated + committed; the open
   step is grading match + localize against the real fleet atlas (`/mnt/x/code/corpora/atlas-fleet.db`)
   and fix against the gateway. Needs a built atlas + gateway creds, so it isn't hermetic — run by the
   user, not a merge gate. Result must be tagged `[authored]` (mechanics, n=3), never `[production]`,
   never blended into the mined `[proxy]` aggregate.

## Services / environment
- **LiteLLM gateway** — creds in the gitignored `/mnt/x/code/loop-agent/.env`, reused by
  `GroundLoop/.env`. Serves: `deepseek-chat`/`deepseek-reasoner` (UP), `bge-m3` (**UP** as of 2026-07-05,
  1024-dim) + `mxbai-embed-large` + `qwen3` (GPU/Ollama-backed — `qwen3` DOWN at last check).
- **Corpora** — `/mnt/x/code/corpora/` at pinned SHAs (`corpus.toml`): android-gpuimage-plus, libxcam,
  ndk-samples. Registry: `corpora/atlas.toml`. Built atlas.db target: `~/.groundloop/atlas.db`.
- **Git** — `master` @ `225f4eb` (first-principles Phase-2 Cycle 4: produce → top-level `codewiki/` + strip),
  pushed to `origin` (`github.com:vinc-lin/GroundLoop.git`) and in sync. **Local branches pruned 2026-07-11:** the merged
  feature branches (`self-scoring-pipeline` + the 8 older `feat/*`: claim-centric-kb, plan-format-fix-stage,
  type2-{eval-e1c,judge-e3,miner-e1b,semantic-e2,substrate-build,symbols-index}) were deleted with `git
  branch -d` after confirming each was merged; **only `master` remains local.**
